# Box Compatibility Project

The Box Compatibility Project aims to collect and analyze data on various types of boxes, focusing on their compatibility with different storage systems. This README file provides an overview of the project and its objectives.

## Project Overview

The goal of the Box Compatibility Project is to create a comprehensive database of boxes, along with their dimensions, features, and compatibility information with different storage systems such as shelves, cabinets, and containers. By gathering this data, we aim to assist individuals and businesses in finding the most suitable boxes for their storage needs and ensuring efficient utilization of space.

The results can be found at [orglikea.pro](https://orglikea.pro/tools/box-compatibility/) including futher functionalities, bellow in this file or can be rendered by your own (see "Rendering the Data").

### Object Kinds
There are different kinds of categories which are defined by the following constraints.

- A **Container** is an object that is filled from above. It does not have overlapping compartments. A typical example of a container is an open cardboard box.
- A **Shelf** is characterized by several compartments on top of each other, which are accessible from the front.
- A **Drawer** cabinet is similar to a shelf, but is also accessed from "above".

Important for all elements is that always the full dimensions are taken. For example, Ikea Kallax has a drawer insert that can ONLY be used with the rule. Here the outer dimensions are those of Kallax and the inner dimensions are those of the drawer.
